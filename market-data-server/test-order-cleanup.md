# Order Cleanup Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Market Maker - Cancel Orders Older Than 30 Minutes
**File**: `/market-maker/src/main/java/com/kalshi/marketmaker/service/MarketMakingService.java`

**What Changed**:
- Updated `cancelAllOrders()` method to check order age before canceling
- Only cancels orders older than 30 minutes (30 * 60 * 1000 ms)
- Logs how old orders are when canceling them
- Keeps recent orders (< 30 minutes) to avoid unnecessary churn

**Code Enhancement**:
```java
// Before: Canceled ALL orders every update cycle
orders.forEach(order -> orderIds.add(orderIdNode.asText()));

// After: Only cancel orders older than 30 minutes
long thirtyMinutesAgo = System.currentTimeMillis() - (30 * 60 * 1000);
if (createdTime < thirtyMinutesAgo) {
    log.info("Canceling old order {}: created {} minutes ago", 
            orderIdNode.asText(), 
            (System.currentTimeMillis() - createdTime) / (60 * 1000));
    orderIds.add(orderIdNode.asText());
}
```

### 2. Mock Exchange - Exclude Canceled Orders from Order Book Loading  
**File**: `/mock-kalshi-fix/src/main/java/com/kalshi/mock/service/PersistenceService.java`

**What Changed**:
- Updated `getOpenOrdersForMarket()` to exclude canceled orders
- Only loads orders from the last 2 days to prevent old data accumulation
- Filters both by status (not canceled) and age (< 2 days)

**Code Enhancement**:
```java
// Before: Loaded all "open" orders (could include very old orders)
String sql = "SELECT *, action FROM orders WHERE market_ticker = ? AND status = 'open'";

// After: Only load recent, non-canceled orders
long twoDaysAgo = System.currentTimeMillis() - (2 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000L);
String sql = "SELECT *, action FROM orders WHERE market_ticker = ? AND status = 'open' AND status != 'canceled' AND created_time >= ?";
```

### 3. Mock Exchange - Startup Order Cleanup
**File**: `/mock-kalshi-fix/src/main/java/com/kalshi/mock/service/PersistenceService.java`

**What Added**:
- New `cleanupOldOrders()` method that runs at startup
- Automatically cancels orders older than 2 days
- Logs cleanup statistics

**New Functionality**:
```java
@Transactional
public void cleanupOldOrders() {
    long twoDaysAgo = System.currentTimeMillis() - (2 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000L);
    
    // Cancel old open orders
    String updateSql = """
        UPDATE orders SET 
            status = 'canceled', 
            remaining_quantity = 0,
            updated_time = ?
        WHERE status = 'open' AND created_time < ?
    """;
    
    int updatedCount = jdbcTemplate.update(updateSql, System.currentTimeMillis(), twoDaysAgo);
    System.out.println("Canceled " + updatedCount + " old orders during startup cleanup");
}
```

### 4. Mock Exchange - Enhanced Order Loading with Age Validation
**File**: `/mock-kalshi-fix/src/main/java/com/kalshi/mock/service/OrderBookService.java`

**What Enhanced**:
- Added startup cleanup call when first market is created
- Enhanced order loading with detailed age logging
- Double-checks order age during loading process

## Benefits

### Memory Efficiency
- **Before**: Order books could accumulate weeks/months of old orders
- **After**: Only keeps recent orders (< 2 days), automatically cleans up old data

### Reduced Server Load
- **Before**: Market maker canceled ALL orders every update (high churn)
- **After**: Only cancels orders that are actually old (< 30 minutes threshold)

### Data Consistency  
- **Before**: Canceled orders could still appear in order books on restart
- **After**: Canceled orders are properly excluded from order book loading

### Operational Visibility
- **Before**: No visibility into order age or cleanup activities
- **After**: Comprehensive logging of order ages and cleanup statistics

## Testing the Changes

Since the Docker builds require compilation, here's how to test the improvements:

1. **Build the projects** with Maven to generate the JAR files
2. **Restart the mock server** - it will run startup cleanup and log old order removal
3. **Start the market maker** - it will only cancel orders older than 30 minutes
4. **Monitor logs** for cleanup activity and age-based order management

## Expected Log Output

### Mock Server Startup:
```
Found 15 old open orders to clean up (older than 2 days)
Canceled 15 old orders during startup cleanup
Loading orders for MARKET_MAKER from the last 2 days
Found 3 recent open orders for market MARKET_MAKER
Loaded order ORD-12345 created 5 minutes ago
```

### Market Maker Runtime:
```
Found 2 orders to cancel (older than 30 minutes)
Canceling old order ORD-11111: created 45 minutes ago
Keeping recent order ORD-22222: created 15 seconds ago
```

This implementation prevents the server from being flooded with dead data while maintaining efficient operation.
